# 1. Permissions Overview

You may use the Software **if the Author checked the right boxes** and if you can read checkboxes without needing a walkthrough.

Allowed uses (select one for each):

* **Personal use:** Allowed
* **Educational use:** Allowed with credit
* **Research use:** Allowed with credit
* **Commercial use:** Allowed with credit

**Compatibility note:**
If any category is “Allowed” or “Allowed with credit,” the Software may be combined with other licenses peacefully, unlike most fanbases.

---

# 2. Modification of the Software

Modify the Software however you want—refactor it, butcher it, turn it into spaghetti code so cursed even StackOverflow will ban you.

* **General rule:** Allowed with credit

**Compatibility clause:**
If your modification is allowed, you may relicense it under MIT, BSD, Apache, GPL, proprietary, or “my dumb custom license that makes no sense” — as long as you keep required attribution.

---

# 3. Distribution of the Software

If you want to share this Software like it's a meme template:

* **General rule:** Allowed with credit

Specific sharing override buttons:

**Compatibility clause:**
If distribution is allowed, you can mix this with any open-source license in a happy multiverse crossover event.

---

# 4. Selling the Software

If you want to put a price tag on this code and pretend you’re an NPC merchant:

* **General rule:** Allowed with permission

**Compatibility clause:**
If selling is allowed, yes, you can shove this into another licensed product, even a proprietary one. Just don’t act surprised when users find bugs and hunt you down.

---

# 5. Attribution Requirements

If the Author demands credit (because they crave XP):

At minimum, include:

* Author: **Berk Ege (brkee)**
* Source: **https://github.com/brkeejp/lively-gradient-ribbons**
* Notice: “Used under the Chaotic Software License (CSL).”
* Optional: a +1 charisma buff for the Author

Attribution must appear in:

* Product credits / README because nobody reads READMEs anyway

**Compatibility clause:**
These attribution rules play nice with MIT, Apache, GPL, and anything else that isn’t completely cursed.

---

# 6. Permission Requests

If any box says “permission,” you must complete the ritual:

* Email: **brkee.jp@gmail.com**
* Subject line may include:

  * “pls dad let me use ur code”
  * “I rolled a nat 1 and need help”
  * “I promise not to do crimes with this”

Permission may be granted as:

* One-time use
* Long-term license
* Royalty-based pact
* Sublicensing allowance
* Revocable like a Twitch ban or irrevocable like that one embarrassing commit message you can’t delete

The Author may approve or deny based on:
mood, caffeine level, dice rolls, horoscope, whether they stubbed their toe today.

---

# 7. Disclaimer of Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITH ZERO WARRANTY, ZERO LORE PROTECTION, AND ZERO PROMISE IT WON’T SUMMON AN ELDRITCH SEGFAULT.
THE AUTHORS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY:
DATA LOSS, SERVER EXPLOSIONS, TIME PARADOXES, MISCAST SPELLS, RAGE QUITS, BSODS, OR ANY OTHER CALAMITY YOU MANAGED TO CAUSE.

This section is legally compatible with MIT/BSD/Apache disclaimers, minus the flavor text.

---

# 8. Termination

If you break this license, all permissions vanish instantly like a hardcore character dying to lag.

Downstream rights others already received stay intact (because legality > spite), but **you** lose everything until the Author feels merciful or bored enough to restore access.

---

# 9. Compatibility Mode (Yes, actually legal)

Unless the Author specifically forbids things above, the CSL is compatible with:

* MIT, BSD, ISC
* Apache-2.0
* MPL-2.0
* LGPL, GPL v2/v3
* Proprietary licenses
* Homebrew licenses
* Whatever unhinged text your friend calls a license
* Creative Commons (if using for non-code parts)

No copyleft is forced unless you choose options that restrict redistribution or modification.

---

# 10. Hidden Geek Easter Eggs (Player Knowledge Only)

These lines aren’t legally required but are canon:

* If you violate the license, a wild segmentation fault appears.
* Every attribution grants +2 luck against production bugs.
* Removing attribution without permission deals 1d10 psychic damage.
* Compiling this Software at midnight may summon undefined behavior.
* The Author reserves the right to shout “git gud” during disputes.
* Using this Software in a AAA studio instantly applies a +500 technical debt curse.
